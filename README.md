## Abstract

A hotel booking web application that allows a customer to login and search/filter available rooms by date and type. Once a room is found the customer can then select and book the room they desire. The room is then added to their list of bookings. All bookings are updated and displayed to the customer. The bookings are sorted from the most future date to most past date. Dates that predate the present are grey'd out while dates to come are highlighted in orange. Included is the the customers all time money spent on bookings. Once a booking is successfully made the customer is presented a message of "booked". When a customer is finished using the application they can click the "logout" button. The page will refresh, removing any customer information, and the login page will re-appear.
